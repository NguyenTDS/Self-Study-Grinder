# Self-Study Grinder

This personal project serves to deepen the content of the Domestika Creative Web Design course and is intended as a proposal for extending the “traditional” Pomodoro Timer.

The concept uses “grinding” mechanics that motivate the user to regularly access the self-study tool. When the user does so, he or she unlocks more visual and aesthetic content that is intended to playfully encourage the user to complete and master online courses, creative work or daily tasks.
